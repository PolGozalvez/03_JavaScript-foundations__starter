/*
    What would each of these lines of code do:

    1. true && console.log("moo"); This shows “moo” because is true.
    2. false && console.log("moo moo?") It shows nothing because it is false.
    3. true || console.log("hello friend"); It shows nothing because it is true.
    4. false || console.log("bye friend"); It shows “bye friend” because it is false, so the second command is executed.

    Once you see the results, write in a comment why it works that way
